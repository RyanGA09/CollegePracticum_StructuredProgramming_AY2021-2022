# College Practicum - Structured Programming First Half Semester (AY 2021-2022)

This project is part of the Structured Programming practicum during the first half of the Academic Year 2021-2022. The primary goal of this project is to practice basic programming skills using C++, focusing on developing a strong foundation in structured programming principles. The project covers fundamental concepts such as algorithm development, program structure, and the use of C++ operators. It is designed to strengthen problem-solving abilities and provide hands-on experience in implementing logic and solving computational problems.

Throughout the practicum, students will engage in various exercises, from basic syntax to more complex tasks, gradually building their programming expertise.

## Features
- Algorithm, Basic C++ programming structure, Flowchart, and C/C++ Operators
- Operation Selection Condition and looping process
- Arrays and String Operations
- Functions and Headers
- Final test exercise to evaluate overall logic and programming skills after completing multiple practicum modules
